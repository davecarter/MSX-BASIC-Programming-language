The MSX (MicroSoft eXtended) was a standardized home computer architecture announced by Microsoft and ASCII Corporation in 1983. It was created to unify the fragmented home computer market in the early 1980s, offering a consistent hardware and software platform. The MSX standard was widely adopted in Japan, parts of Europe, South America, and the Middle East.

### Key Brands Adopting MSX:
- Sony: Produced some of the most iconic MSX machines, including the HitBit series.
- Panasonic: Known for its high-quality MSX2 and MSX2+ computers.
- Philips: Prominent in Europe, offering MSX systems like the VG-8020.
- Toshiba, Yamaha, Canon, Mitsubishi: These brands also contributed hardware to the MSX ecosystem.

### Interesting Facts:

#### Gaming Platform
The MSX was a powerhouse for early gaming, hosting classics like Metal Gear by Konami, which debuted on MSX.
Multiple Generations: MSX evolved through several iterations: MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and MSX Turbo R, each adding advanced capabilities.

#### Global Appeal
While it struggled in the U.S., the MSX was highly successful in Japan, the Netherlands, and Brazil, becoming a cultural icon in those regions.
Music and Creativity: Yamaha's MSX machines included features for music composition, aligning with the company's expertise in musical instruments.
The MSX remains a beloved platform among retro computing enthusiasts, celebrated for its versatility, gaming legacy, and role in standardizing home computers.

## Getting started

### Emulator or Real Hardware
- Online emulator: Try it online at [FileHunter/MSXdev](https://www.file-hunter.com/MSXdev/)
- Software Emulator: Install an MSX emulator like [openMSX](https://openmsx.org/) or [blueMSX](http://bluemsx.msxblue.com/download.html). These provide a virtual MSX environment on modern computers.
- Real MSX Computer: If you own an actual MSX machine, youâ€™ll need compatible storage media (e.g., floppy disks, cassette tapes, or flash cartridges like the MegaFlashROM).

### Development Tools
- MSX BASIC: Built into the MSX firmware, BASIC is perfect for beginners.
- Cross-Development Tools: Use modern tools like SDCC or MSX-DOS compilers to write programs on your PC and run them on an MSX emulator or real hardware.
- Text Editor: Write your code in any plain text editor (e.g., Notepad++, VS Code) for cross-development.

### ROMs or Disk Images
For testing or running programs, you'll need software, games, or blank disk images compatible with MSX.
