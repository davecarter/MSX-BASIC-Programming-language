# Getting Started with MSX BASIC Programming  

This guide introduces fundamental MSX BASIC commands and how to use the built-in MSX code editor.

BASIC stands for **Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code**. It was designed to teach computer programming concepts easily. In MSX you'll find an improved version able to run in any other computer using this MSX standar.

## Accessing the MSX BASIC Environment
1. Turn on your MSX computer or emulator, and it should boot directly into the BASIC interpreter, showing a prompt like `Ok`.

2. From here, you can start typing commands directly or writing programs.

## Useful Commands to Begin

### NEW  
> Clears the current program from memory  

```basic
  NEW
```
### AUTO
> Automatically generates line numbers as you type,  value.

```basic
  AUTO 10,10
```
Starts line numbering at 10 and increments by 10 for each new line, helping you manage your program structure.

Stop AUTO mode with the STOP key.

### COLOR
> Sets the screen colors (foreground, background, and border).


```basic
COLOR 7,0,1
```

Sets the text color to white (7), the background to black (0), and the border to blue (1).

### LIST
> Displays the current program stored in memory.

```basic
LIST
```
Shows all lines in the program. To view specific lines, use:

```basic
LIST 10-30
```
### RUN
> Executes the program in memory.

```basic
RUN
```

Runs the program from the first line.

### PRINT
> Displays text or values on the screen.
```basic
10 REM This is a comment
20 PRINT "LOADING"
```

### Writing a Simple Program
Hereâ€™s an example program to get you started:
```basic
10 CLS
20 COLOR 7,0,1
30 PRINT "WELCOME TO MSX BASIC!"
40 INPUT "What is your name? "; N$
50 PRINT "HELLO "; N$; "!"
60 END

```

### Tips for Beginners
Always start with CLS and COLOR to make the screen output clear and visually appealing.
Use AUTO to keep your code organized with line numbers.

Experiment with mathematical operations (PRINT 2+3) and loops (e.g., using FOR and NEXT).
